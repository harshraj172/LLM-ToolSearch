One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements.

Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements.

One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements.

The architecture of the model is very similar to that of a standard Vision Transformer (ViT), with a decoder on top for predicting pixel values for masked patches. Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available.

One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder.

The model is trained using a bipartite matching loss: one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a no object as class and no bounding box as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model."}

BigBird relies on block sparse attention instead of normal attention (i.e. BERT's attention) and can handle sequences up to a length of 4096 at a much lower compute cost compared to BERT. It has achieved SOTA on various tasks involving very long sequences such as long documents summarization, question-answering with long contexts."}

TAPEX realizes table pre-training by learning a neural SQL executor over a synthetic corpus, which is obtained by automatically synthesizing executable SQL queries. TAPEX is based on the BART architecture, the transformer encoder-decoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and an autoregressive (GPT-like) decoder. This model is the tapex-base model fine-tuned on the WikiTableQuestions dataset."}
