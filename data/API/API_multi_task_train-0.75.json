One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder.

The architecture of the model is very similar to that of a standard Vision Transformer (ViT), with a decoder on top for predicting pixel values for masked patches. Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations.

While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we show that other ingredients are important for a high-performing chatbot. Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available.

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available.

The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations.

One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we show that other ingredients are important for a high-performing chatbot. Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements.

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

It builds hierarchical feature maps by merging image patches in deeper layers and has linear computation complexity to input image size due to computation of self-attention only within each local window. Swin Transformer v2 adds 3 main improvements: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) a log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) a self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images."}

Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available.

The model was fine-tuned and evaluated on 15 data sets from diverse text sources to enhance generalization across different types of texts (reviews, tweets, etc.). Consequently, it outperforms models trained on only one type of text (e.g., movie reviews from the popular SST-2 benchmark) when used on new data as shown below."}

One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."}

Moreover, BigBird comes along with a theoretical understanding of the capabilities of a complete transformer that the sparse model can handle. BigBird was introduced in this paper and first released in this repository. BigBird relies on block sparse attention instead of normal attention (i.e. BERT's attention) and can handle sequences up to a length of 4096 at a much lower compute cost compared to BERT. It has achieved SOTA on various tasks involving very long sequences such as long documents summarization, question-answering with long contexts."}

The model is trained using a bipartite matching loss: one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a no object as class and no bounding box as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model."}

Moreover, BigBird comes along with a theoretical understanding of the capabilities of a complete transformer that the sparse model can handle. BigBird was introduced in this paper and first released in this repository. BigBird relies on block sparse attention instead of normal attention (i.e. BERT's attention) and can handle sequences up to a length of 4096 at a much lower compute cost compared to BERT. It has achieved SOTA on various tasks involving very long sequences such as long documents summarization, question-answering with long contexts."}
